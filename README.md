# text-editor

## Description
The code included in this repository is used to create a text editor application. The application is run from the command line and uses node, express, and MongoDB to store and retrieve data. The bullets below outline the functionality of the application.
* When the user opens the application in their editor, they will see a client server folder structure.
* When the user runs `npm run start` from the root directory, the application will start up the backend and serve the client.
* When the user runs the text editor application from their terminal, they will find that their JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.
* When the user runs their webpack plugins, they will find that they have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
* When the user uses next-gen JavaScript in their application, they will find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.
* When the user opens the text editor, they will find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
* When the user enters content and subsequently clicks off of the DOM window, they will find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.
* When the user reopens the text editor after closing it, they will find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.
* When the user clicks on the Install button, they will download their web application as an icon on their desktop.
* When the user loads their web application, they will have a registered service worker using workbox.
* When the user registers a service worker, they will have their static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.
* When the user deploys to Render, they will have proper build scripts for a webpack application.
